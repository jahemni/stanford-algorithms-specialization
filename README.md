## Introduction

Algorithms are fundamental to computer science. This specialization dives deep into various algorithms, teaching both theory and practical applications. By working through the assignments and projects, I have gained a better understanding of how to approach algorithmic problems.

## Topics Covered

This repository includes work on the following topics:

- **Algorithms**: Fundamental techniques for solving problems.
- **Computational Theory**: Understanding the limits of what can be computed.
- **Data Structures**: Organizing data for efficient access and modification.
- **Design Strategy**: Approaches to tackle complex problems.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Breaking problems into smaller, manageable parts.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solving problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.
- **Graph Theory**: Studying graphs and their properties.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Making the locally optimal choice at each stage.
- **NP-Complete Problems**: Exploring problems that are computationally hard.
- **Probability**: Understanding randomness and uncertainty.
- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: A classic optimization problem.
